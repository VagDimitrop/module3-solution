In this assignment of the Coursera Course "HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" the goal was to use the Bootstrap framework in order
to create a responsive site using the Bootstrap Grid adn the Bootstrap CSS class prefixes, i.e., md, sm, and xs, instead of specifying pixel 
ranges. 

Desktop mockup illustration corresponds to Bootstrap md-based classes
Tablet mockup illustration corresponds to Bootstrap sm-based classes
Mobile mockup illustration corresponds to Bootstrap xs-based classes

Furthermore, the site has a navbar with the company's logo, that is not locked on top of the page when scrolling down but it scrolls with 
the page. For desktop and tablet view, the navbar does not contain anything, while in mobile view there is a simple menu button that contains
3 horizontal lines. Each one of them contains one of the three items that the store provides. When the user clicks on the meny button, the 
menu button takes up the whole width of the browser.
